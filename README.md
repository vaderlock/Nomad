# Project Overview

#### Our decentralized application aims to revolutionize the way individuals represent themselves on the web3 by enabling them to own their social identity with the use of cross chain NFTs. Instead of relying on multiple wallet addresses, our platform empowers users to hold a unique NFT that includes their username, profile picture, and bio. With this approach, users can effortlessly showcase their web3 presence across various platforms, while maintaining complete control over their personal information. Our platform represents a significant step towards a more secure, private, and user-centric web3 experience.

# Repository Outline

### Backend: Contains all the necessary code that we used to deploy our nft-linker contract on our local network.

#### You can find our ERC721 contract that is powered by thirdweb by querying the following contract address on goerli testnet etherscan : 0x56425f39cBC8fC1B5b4F34b4a7C4aA97E7fF090E

#### You can find our axelar interchain transaction by querying the following address on axelarscan: 0x302119f374c7D85D2f306Dde28F218d18501AcD6 

#### Positive Experience with Axelar: First time working with cross-chain technology and it was a joyful experience learning about how the technology works in practice

#### Negative Experience with Axelar: Project github needs more detailed documentation with the codebase as well as some parts of the example code was not working properly.
